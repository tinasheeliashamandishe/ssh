<h1>SSH Configuration</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will show steps to configure and access a Cisco device through SSH.<br/>
Configurations are done on a Router, but the same commands can be used on Switch.

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel between two computers, enabling encrypted communication and secure remote administration.
<br/><br/>
Here are some common uses of SSH:
<br/>
<b>Remote Access:</b> SSH allows users to securely log in to a remote system over a network, providing a command-line interface for managing files, executing commands, and performing administrative tasks on the remote machine. This is particularly useful for system administrators who need to manage servers or network devices remotely.
<br/>
<b>Secure File Transfer:</b> SSH includes utilities such as SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), which allow users to securely transfer files between two computers. This is often used to upload or download files to and from servers securely.
<br/>
<b>Tunneling:</b> SSH can create secure tunnels between a local and a remote machine, allowing traffic to be securely transmitted between them. This is commonly used for accessing services securely over an untrusted network, such as accessing a database server or browsing the web through an encrypted connection.
<br/>
<b>Remote Command Execution:</b> SSH enables users to execute commands on a remote system securely, which can be useful for automating tasks or executing commands on multiple remote machines simultaneously.
<br/>
<b>Secure Remote Administration:</b> System administrators can use SSH to remotely manage servers and network devices securely, including tasks such as configuring settings, monitoring system performance, and troubleshooting issues.
<br/><br/>
Overall, SSH plays a crucial role in enabling secure communication and remote administration over networks, making it an essential tool for many IT professionals and organizations.
